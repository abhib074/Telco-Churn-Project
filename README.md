# Telco-Churn-Project
Churn prediction is a common use case in machine learning domain. 
It is a project that would predict the churning rate of customers from the company.
Here, I have used two models i.e., Ridge Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.

Feel free to contribute and make the model more stronger.
Currently, the random forest classifier is giving an accuracy of 86%.
